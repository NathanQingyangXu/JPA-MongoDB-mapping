== JPA and MongoDB
JPA (**J**arkata **P**ersistence **A**PI) is an SQL persistence contract aiming to bridge the gap between Java OOP (**O**bject
**O**riented **P**rogramming) paradigm and relational database model.
Hibernate library as the reference implementation of JPA is the de facto ORM (**O**bject **R**elational **M**apping) framework in which
Java developer could interact with POJOs whereas ORM library takes care of boilerplate JDBC processing
automatically.

MongoDB is a document NoSQL database, so seemingly JPA could not be applied directly, though the similar ORM spirit is still
highly attractive to Java developers. Furthermore, MongoDB provides many features aligning with SQL databases (e.g. transaction, table joining simulation by view, etc.),
so it seems a natural candidate to enjoy some benefits of ORM framework. Let us call it OMM (**O**bject **M**ongoDB **M**apping) then.

=== Existing Open Source Libraries (active or not)
It is not surprising that Hibernate once started an ambitious project to generalize Hibernate ORM features to all NoSQL databases.
They call it https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm[Hibernate OGM] (**O**bject **G**rid **M**apping) as a big umbrella including Infinitispan, MongoDB, Neo4j, etc.
However, it lacks some basic JPA features (e.g. Criteria and Filter) and ceased to be actively maintained any more. It is based on outdated Hibernate v5 core library models. Given the leap of faith of Hibernate
v6 release, it is extremely challenging to revive it by integrating with v6's new query model, if possible.

*Spring Data MongoDB* (https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb) is a good choice for CRUD tasks, but it is a sibling project to
*Spring Data JPA*, not a super set, thus lacking many important JPA features. For instance:

* POJO OOP programming paradigm
* JP-QL/HQL and Criteria
* Entity Graph
* Second-level Cache

There used to be lesser known libraries aiming Mongodb mapping exclusively every now and again, but usually they are not actively maintained and phased out quickly.

== Chameleon: a new OMM library
The author of this library is an experienced Hibernate contributor and participated actively in both v5 and v6 development.
He humbly proposed a new OMM idea and this github project is the end result. The idea is simple and boils down to the following principles:

* loose coupling with Hibernate core library so future Hibernate evolution won't break OMM
* focus on providing a "Virtual JDBC Driver" on top of Mongodb's Java driver; the "Virtual JDBC Driver" will pass JSON instead of SQL though

=== Implementation Details
Since Hibernate v6, a unified SQM (**S**emantic **Q**uery **M**odel) was created for both JP-QL and Criteria. It is not only an elegant
tech design but also streamlines vendor specific SQL or NoSQL statement generation. In Chameleon, we could easily create parameterized Mongodb Bson command string
ready to be run by Mongodb java driver. The virtual JDBC driver will pass the JSON string instead of SQL between Hibernate and Mongodb
server.
No need to overwrite or bypass Hibernate's core workflow for vendor specific SQL rendering is a standardized core feature of Hibernate, and ultimately Hibernate sits on top
of JDBC layer invariably. Our "Virtual JDBC Driver" will act as an adapter between JDBC contract and MongoDB, so the customization is outside of Hibernate's scope.

=== Some Caveats
Obviously we can't anticipate all JPA features (entity class and JPA annotations, JP-QL or HQL statements) has one-to-one
counterpart in MongoDB, but luckily MongoDB provides counterparts or simulation to great extent, e.g.:

* SQL table joining: MongoDB has collection joining simulation (`$lookup` and `$unwind` stages of `aggregate` pipeline)
* transaction: since Mongodb v4, transaction is provided
* embedding array field: since https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.1/migration-guide/migration-guide.html[Hibernate v6.1], JDBC's
ARRAY type is supported

== Mongodb Integration Unit Testing

A locally running *mongod* process should have been launched (at the default port of _27017_).

Default connection string is *mongodb://localhost/test*.

Before any testing case is started, all the collections in the testing database will be dropped.
